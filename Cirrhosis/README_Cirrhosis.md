This codelist was compiled using the following search terms within the EMIS medical dictionary:

cirrho (sis/tic)  
varice (s/al)  
portal hypertensi (on/ve)  
ascit (es/ic)  
chronic hep failure  
end stage liver disease
child-pugh

Terms were extracted from ICD-10, SNOMED codelists and existing publicly available codelists.

Terms selected were for the purpose of identifying patients with cirrhosis in CPRD data using a recorded diagnosis of cirrhosis 
or with complications almost entirely occurring only in the presence of cirrhosis.

NB Jaundice was not included due to low sensitivity.  
Fibrosis and sclerosis were not deemed as cirrhosis.
