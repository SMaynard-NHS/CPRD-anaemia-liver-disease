# CPRD-anaemia-liver-disease
DPhil project - using routine primary care data for research into anaemia in liver disease.

Codelists here are for identification of patients and covariates relevant to the research project above using CPRD data.  

They have been developed and checked by two independent medical practitioners for this purpose.

The content is available for review by journals and researchers who may find them helpful. HOWEVER content of codelists required will differ according to your research. Using these codelists without checking and updating may result in you missing important codes, or including codes not relevant to your project.

CPRD codes change frequently, therefore it is recommended to use and maintain search strategies, not codelists. 

With that in mind, you may therefore find the list of search terms more helpful as a starting point, and use them to browse up to date browser files within the programme of your choice (e.g. R, stata, Python)

Happy searching!
